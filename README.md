## Project Overview

Audiophile is a small-scale e-commerce website featuring a limited selection of audio products. Although a simpler solution could have been implemented for a site of this size, I chose a more JavaScript heavy approach.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Catalog**: Automatically populated product details page using JSON data.
- **View Products**: Browse the product catalog, view details, and add items to your cart.
- **Checkout**: Review your cart, provide shipping information, and place an order.
- **Backend Integration**: Node.js-based backend for order management.
- **Responsive Design** across all device sizes.
- **Accessibility score above 95%**
