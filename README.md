## Project Overview

Audiophile is a small-scale e-commerce website featuring a limited selection of audio products. Although a simpler solution could have been implemented for a site of this size, I deliberately chose a more complex and robust approach. Through this project, I aimed to **simulate real-world development scenarios**, including challenges like data management, server-side logic, and creating a content management system (CMS).

## Features
* **Dynamic Product Catalog**: Automatically populated product details page using JSON data.
* **View Products**: Browse the product catalog, view details, and add items to your cart.
* **Checkout**: Review your cart, provide shipping information, and place an order.
* **Backend Integration**: Node.js-based backend for product catalog and order management.
* **Content Management System** (To be added in Phase 4): Admin panel for managing products and viewing orders. 
    > Live demo: to be added
* **Responsive Design** across all device sizes.
* **Accessibility score above 95%**
