# Audiophile

# Project Overview

Audiophile is a small-scale e-commerce website featuring a limited selection of audio products. While the scope of this project might seem modest, my goal was to **treat it as though I were developing a large, professional-grade website**. This approach allowed me to thoroughly exercise and enhance my skills in backend development, database management, and best practices in web development.

Although a simpler solution could have been implemented for a site of this size, I deliberately chose a more complex and robust approach. Through this project, I aimed to simulate real-world development scenarios, including challenges like data management, server-side logic, and creating a content management system (CMS).

Your users should be able to:

* Add/Remove products from the cart
* Edit product quantities in the cart
* Fill in all fields in the checkout
* Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
* See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
* Shipping always adds $50 to the order
* VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
* See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
* View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
